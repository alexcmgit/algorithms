8 months since my last attempt on this problem (Kotlin's solution #1). Took it as a challenge this time, and I'm satisfied with the performance, unlike the last try.

Time and space complexity are considered constant due to the fixed constraint `1 <= num <= 10^8`. However, if we treat the number of digits in num as the input size, the complexity becomes linear, since the solution iterates through the digits and performs basic list manipulations.

Additionally, I avoided using strings in this solution, though I may explore that approach in the future.
