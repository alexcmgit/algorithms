A permutation is the number of different ways in which 'n' objects can be arranged. A good example of a permutation is determining how many ways the letters "ABCD" can be arranged. You could solve this by the "brute force" method and list all possible combinations:

Although this method works, it is very inefficient and very time-consuming. There is a neater way to do this. If we think of the way these four letters can be arranged, then we know that 4 letters can be in position one, 3 letters can go into position two, 2 letters can go into position three, and 1 letter can go into position four.

So the four letters can be arranged in 4 • 3 • 2 • 1 = 24 ways.

NOTE: This is also called 4 factorial or 4!

For the sake of our programs memory, test cases are made up to the **20!** (last computable factorial in a **signed 64-bit integer**).
