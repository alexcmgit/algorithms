  <p> In the 8th episode of Big Bang Theory's second season, <i>The Lizard-Spock Expansion,</i> Sheldon and Raj are arguing about what is the best: the movie <i>Saturn 3</i> or the TV show <i>Deep Space 9</i>. Raj suggests rock-paper-scissors to settle down the dispute. However, Sheldon says "Ooh, I don't think so. No, anectodal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock".</p>
  <p>The rules of the game are:</p><ol><li>scissors cuts paper;</li><li>paper covers rock;</li><li>rock crushes lizard;</li><li>lizard poisons Spock;</li><li>Spock smashes scissors;</li><li>scissors decapitates lizard;</li><li>lizard eats paper;</li><li>paper disproves Spock;</li><li>Spock vaporizes rock;</li><li>rock crushes scissors.</li></ol><p></p>
  <p>Both choosed Spock and the game tied. However, it isn't hard to realize what would happened if the game had continued. In the case of Sheldon's victory, he would've said: "Bazinga!"; if Raj had won, Sheldon would declare: "Raj trapaceou!" ("Raj cheated" in portuguese); in ties, he would request a new game: "De novo!" ("Again!", in portuguese). Given the options chosen by both, make a program that prints Sheldon reaction to the outcome.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>The first line contains an integer <b>T</b>
  (<b>T</b> ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case is described using one line. The line contains Sheldon and Raj options, separated by one blank space. The possible options are: pedra, papel, tesoura, lagarto e Spock (rock, paper, scissors, lizard and Spock).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>For each test case your program must output a single line with the following message: "Caso #<b>t</b>: <b>R</b>", where <b>t</b> is the test case number and <b>R</b> is Sheldon's reaction to the outcome: "Bazinga!", "Raj trapaceou!", or "De novo!".</p>
