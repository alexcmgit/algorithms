  <p>Blind tea tasting is the skill of identifying a tea by using only your senses of smell and taste.<br>
  <br>
   As part of the Ideal Challenge of Pure-Tea Consumers (ICPC), a local TV show is organized. During the show, a full teapot is prepared and five contestants are handed a cup of tea each. The participants must smell, taste and assess the sample so as to identify the tea type, which can be: (1) white tea; (2) green tea; (3) black tea; or (4) herbal tea. At the end, the answers are checked to determine the number of correct guesses.<br>
  <br>
   Given the actual tea type and the answers provided, determine the number of contestants who got the correct answer.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>The first line contains an integer <strong>T</strong> representing the tea type (1 ≤ <strong>T</strong> ≤ 4). The second line contains five integers <strong>A, B, C, D</strong> and <strong>E</strong>, indicating the answer given by each contestant (1 ≤ <strong>A, B, C, D, E </strong>≤ 4).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>Output a line with an integer representing the number of contestants who got the correct answer.</p>
