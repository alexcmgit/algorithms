  <p>Cacunda, Bizz and Massacote are inseparable friends. In college, in a few days, they did not go to class to play tricks. One day a teacher was passing by. At the same time, the three of them shouted the word "gzuz" loudly. After this cry, they became invisible, and the teacher did not see them. Again, their class was answering questions from the teacher. When it was the turn of one of them, they would respond with the word "gzuz", and the teacher would accept the answer and give the maximum mark of the question. Make the simulation of the output they found to get out of the most diverse problems.</p>
