   The <em>Federação Gaúcha de Futebol</em> invited you to write a program to present a statistical result of several GRENAIS. Write a program that read the number of goals scored by Inter and the number of goals scored by Gremio in a GRENAL. Write the message "Novo grenal (1-sim 2-nao)" and request a response. If the answer is 1, two new numbers must be read (another input case) asking the number of goals scored by the teams in a new departure, otherwise the program must be finished, printing:</p>
  <p>
   - How many GRENAIS were part of the statistics.<br>
   - The number of victories of Inter.<br>
   - The number of victories of Gremio.<br>
   - The number of Draws.<br>
   - A message indicating the team that won the largest number of GRENAIS (or the message: "Não houve vencedor" if both team won the same quantity of GRENAIS).</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>
   The input contains two integer values​​, corresponding to the goals scored by both teams. Then there is an integer (1 or 2), corresponding to the repetition of the algorithm.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>
   After each reading of the goals it must be printed the message "Novo grenal (1-sim 2-nao)". When the program is finished, the program must print the statistics as the example below.</p>
