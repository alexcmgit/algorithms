  So so far away there is a pacific kingdom called Lá-Ara. Lá-Ara leader, the king Naldo, a great pokemon master, is in trouble. A rare mathematician pokemon called Evil-Son invades his territory and it threatened to destroy everything if nobody answer the challenge described as follow.</p>
  <p>
   A set of lines in the pane is said to be in <em>general position</em>
  if no two lines are parallel and no three lines intersect at a common point. Inside the rectangle of figure (A) we have a set of lines in general position, in other hand, inside the rectangle of figure (B) we have represented a set of lines that isn't in general position.</p>

  The challenge consists in compute the number of regions in the plane created by a set of <strong>N</strong> lines in general position. The king Naldo needs your mathematics and programming skills to save the Lá-Ara kingdom of evil Evil-Son.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>The input consists of many instances of the problem. The first line contains just an integer <strong>T</strong> that represents the number of instances.</p>
  <p>
   Each instance consists of one line thats has the number <strong>N</strong>
  representing the number of lines in the set.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>
  For each instance in the input, prints a line with the number of regions created in the plane by the lines in the set.</p>
