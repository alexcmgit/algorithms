 Fiona has always loved poetry, and recently she discovered a fascinating poetical form. <em>Tautograms</em> are a special case of alliteration, which is the occurrence of the same letter at the beginning of adjacent words. In particular, a sentence is a tautogram if all of its words start with the same letter.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
 For instance, the following sentences are tautograms:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
   Flowers Flourish from France</li>
  <li>
   Sam Simmonds speaks softly</li>
  <li>
   Peter pIckEd pePPers</li>
  <li>
   truly tautograms triumph</li>
</ul>
<div>
   Fiona wants to dazzle her boyfriend with a romantic letter full of this kind of sentences. Please help Fiona to check if each sentence she wrote down is a tautogram or not.</div>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
<div>
 Each test case is given in a single line that contains a sentence. A sentence consists of a sequence of at most 50 words separated by single spaces. A word is a sequence of at most 20 contiguous uppercase and lowercase letters from the English alphabet. A word contains at least one letter and a sentence contains at least one word.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
   The last test case is followed by a line containing only a single character '*' (asterisk).</div>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>
   For each test case output a single line containing an uppercase 'Y' if the sentence is a tautogram, or an uppercase 'N' otherwise.</p>
