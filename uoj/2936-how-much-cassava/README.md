  <p>Every year in April, the Curupira, Boitatá, the pink Boto (this one in his man form, as Dona Chica likes it better), Mapinguari and Iara meet at Dona Chica to remember their moments with Mani, the beautiful girl with the white skin. And as it could not be different the main dish of this meeting is the cassava. Each one of them eats one to ten servings of cassava and they always warn Dona. Chica in advance about how many servings they will eat that day. The size of the portion of each is different, but they are always the same. The portions are as follows (in grams):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Curupira eats 300</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Boitatá eats 1500</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Boto eats 600</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mapinguari eats 1000</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Iara eats 150</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dona chica in turn always eats 225 grams of cassava. Tired of every year having to figure out how much cassava to prepare she contacted you to write a program that tells how much cassava should be prepared in grams.</p>
