   Little John wants to calculate and show the amount of spent fuel liters on a trip, using a car that does 12 Km/L. For this, he would like you to help him through a simple program. To perform the calculation, you have to read spent time (in hours) and the same average speed (km/h). In this way, you can get distance and then, calculate how many liters would be needed. Show the value with three decimal places after the point.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>
   The input file contains two integers. The first one is the spent time in the trip (in hours). The second one is the average speed during the trip (in Km/h).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>
   Print how many liters would be needed to do this trip, with three digits after the decimal point.</p>
</div>
