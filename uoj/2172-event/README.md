  <p>Prog and Cackto recently started to play a role-playing game called Fortress. In this game, for player's evolve their level they need to defeat monsters, which gives a value of experience (XP) for player.</p>
  <p>The producer of the game, Extreme Games, announced that next week will hold the first XP event of this game in which will increase monsters experience in an <strong>X</strong> value. As Prog and Cackto are at a very high level at which the monsters have a very high amount of experience points, they are having difficulties in calculating the amount of experience points that the monsters will have during the event. You can help them?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

  <p>There will be several test cases. Each test case contains two values: <strong>X</strong> (0 &lt;<strong> X</strong> ≤ 3) indicating the increase in value of EXP from monsters and <strong>M</strong> (10 ≤ <strong>M</strong> ≤ 2<sup>32</sup>-1) indicating the EXP value of the monster. The entry ends with values <strong>X</strong> == 0 and <strong>M</strong> == 0, in which should not be processed.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>For each case, your program should show a value <strong>E</strong>, value of new Monster EXP.</p>
