  <p>Péricles has an unique interest in history. With his up-to-date internet browser <em>chromed fox</em>, he wandered in the most obscure sites about ancient Greek mythology.</p>
  <p>
   By some type of cosmic irony, Péricles' browser was infected by a <em>malware </em>with a peculiar characteristic: every time Péricles closed a tab in his browser, another two opened! However, when Péricles clicked one of the ads (all tabs were infested with ads), the tab crashed, and no other tabs were opened.</p>
  <p>
   Your taks is to compute the final number of tabs of Péricles's browser, knowing the initial number of tabs and the actions taken by Péricles. There are two possible actions: <em>fechou </em>(when Péricles closed a tab) and<em> </em><em>clicou </em>(when Péricles clicked on an ad).</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>The input is initiated by a line containing two integer numbers, <strong>N </strong>and <strong>M (0</strong> &lt; <strong>N, M &lt; 500), </strong>representing the initial number of tabs and the number of actions performed by Péricles. Each subsequent line contains an action (<em>fechou </em>or <em>clicou</em>). Naturally, the current number of tabs is always greater or equal to zero.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>The output must consist of a line containing the final number of tabs.</p>
