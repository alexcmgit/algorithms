  <p> Write a program that reads two integers: <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> (<strong>Z</strong> must be read as many times as necessary, until a number greater than <strong>X</strong> is read). Count how many integers must be summed in sequence (starting at and including <strong>X</strong>) so that the sum exceeds <strong>Z</strong> the minimum possible and writes this number. <br> <br> The input may have, for example, the numbers ​​21 21 15 30. In this case, the number 21 is assumed for <strong>X</strong>, The numbers 21 and 15 must be ignored because they are smaller or equal to <strong>X</strong>. The number 30 is within the specification (greater than <strong>X</strong>) and is valid. So, the final result must be 2 for this test case, because the sum (21 + 22) is bigger than 30.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>The input contains only integer values​​, one per line, which may be positive or negative. The first number is the value of <strong>X</strong>. The next line will contain <strong>Z</strong>. If <strong>Z</strong> does not meet the specification of the problem, it should be read again, as many times as necessary.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>
   Print a line with an integer number representing the among of integer numbers that must be summed.</p>
