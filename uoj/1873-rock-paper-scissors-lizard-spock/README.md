  <p>Rock-paper -scissors - lizard - Spock is an expansion of the classical method of selection for playing rock-paper- scissors. It operates under the same basic principle , but includes two other additional weapons : the lizard (formed by the hand like a puppet 's mouth ) and Spock ( formed by greeting the Vulcans in Star Trek ) . This reduces the chances of a round end in a draw . The game was invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla like " Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock ." In this version, the possible outcomes are:</p>
  <p>• Scissors cuts paper</p>
  <p>• Paper covers rock</p>
  <p>• Rock tips lizard</p>
  <p>• Lizard Spock falls asleep</p>
  <p>• Spock melts scissors</p>
  <p>• Scissors holds lizard</p>
  <p>• lizard eats paper</p>
  <p>• Paper disproves spock</p>
  <p>• Spock vaporizes rock</p>
  <p>• Rock crushes scissors </p>
  <p>In Portuguese, this game is called "Pedra-papel-tesoura-lagarto-Spock", and the weapons are "pedra" (rock), "papel" (paper), "tesoura" (scissors), "lagarto" (lizard) and "Spock" (Spock).</p>
  <p>One day , two friends Rajesh and Sheldon, decided to bet who would pay a lunch for the other, with this joke. Its mission will be to make an algorithm that , based on what they choose , tell who will win or will tie.</p>
