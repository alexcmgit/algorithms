      Some texts contain hidden messages. In the context of this problem, the hidden message of a text is composed of the first letter from each word in the text, in the order they appear.</p>
      <p>
      Given a text consisting of only lowercase letters and spaces, return the hidden message. A word is a maximal sequence of consecutive letters. There may be multiple spaces between words. The text may start in spaces, end in spaces or even contain spaces only.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
       The input contains many test cases. The first line contains an integer <strong>N</strong> that indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing from 1 to 50 characters, that can be lowercase letters (‘a’-‘z’) or spaces (‘&nbsp;’). Watch out for leading and trailing spaces!<br><br>
       Note: In the sample imput, spaces were replaced by small dots (‘·’) to provide a better understanding of the samples.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
       For each test case print the text that is hidden in the input.</p>
