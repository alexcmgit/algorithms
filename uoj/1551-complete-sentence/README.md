  <p>Your English teacher loves to bring new stuff to the class, and today it wasn't different. There is a city, according to your teacher, where the people take really seriously the way they talk to each other. In particular, when two people are talking, they think a lot in the sentence that they are going to say before they say it, so that they can ensure their sentence will be a “full sentence”, or maybe an “almost full sentence”.</p>
  <p>Considering our 26 letters alphabet, a sentence is “full” if, and only if, it has all the letters of our alphabet in it. In a similar way, a sentence is “almost full” if, and only if, it is not “full”, but has at least half of the letters of our alphabet in it. When a sentence is not “full” neither “almost full”, it is “poorly designed”.</p>
  <p>Your teacher gave you a really hard task: given several sentences exchanged between several people from the quoted city, say in which of the given categories each sentence fits in.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>The first line contains an integer <strong>N</strong>, indicating the number of test cases to follow.</p>
  <p>Each test case contains one line, containing lowercase letters, white spaces and/or commas. The number of characters of each line is at least 3 and at most 1000, counting the spaces.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>For each test case, print one line containing one of the following sentences: “frase completa”, when the sentence is considered full; “frase quase completa”, when the sentence is not considered full, but is considered almost full; or “frase mal elaborada”, when the sentence is not full neither almost full.</p>
