  <p>Tired of washing your dirty clothes, your mother decided that, for now on, who washes your clothes is you.</p>
  <p>On the laundry room of your home there is a washer and a dryer, each with its own limits of minimum and maximum amount of clothes to be washed and dried per time. Therefore, the washer can only be used if you put at least <strong>LA</strong> and at most <strong>LB</strong> clothes inside it, and similarly the dryer can only be used if you put at least <strong>SA</strong> and at most <strong>SB</strong> clothes inside it.</p>
  <p>You currently have <strong>N</strong> clothes to be washed and dried, and you want to find out if it is possible to use the washer and dryer to wash and dry all of your clothes, following the rules described above.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>

  <p>On the second line of input there are two integers <strong>LA</strong> and <strong>LB</strong> (1 ≤ <strong>LA</strong> &lt; <strong>LB</strong> ≤ 100).</p>
  <p>On the third line of input there are two integers <strong>SA</strong> and <strong>SB</strong> (1 ≤ <strong>SA</strong> &lt; <strong>SB</strong> ≤ 100).</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
