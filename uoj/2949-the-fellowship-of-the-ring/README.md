    <p>Frodo was a little hobbit (small, hairy-footed people) who lived quietly in the Shire, taking his various breakfasts filled with many succulent foods that a good hobbit diet provides.<br>
     One day his Uncle Bilbo hands him his famous golden ring, and Gandalf, a very "cool" mage, tells Frodo that this ring was not normal and should be thrown on the Mountain of Doom, so that a great evil would be avoided. For this journey, an entourage was formed, composed of dwarves, elves, humans, hobbits and magicians.<br>
     Frodo wants to know the amount of each race that will go with him for the journey. Given a list of people who enlisted, report back to Frodo from the entourage.</p>
  </div>
