  <p>
   Specifically, we want to know the most frequently occurring letter(s) in the text, ignoring case (to be clear, "letters" refers precisely to the 26 letters of the alphabet).</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div>
  <p>
   The input contains many test cases. The first line contains an integer <strong>N</strong> that indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line of text. The line may contain non-letter characters, but is guaranteed to contain at least one letter and less than 200 characters in total.</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div>
  <p>
   For each test case, output a line containing the most frequently occurring letter(s) from the text in lowercase (if there are ties, output all such letters in alphabetical order).</p>
</div>
