# Pythagorean expression

Assume that the two short sides of a right triangle have length 3 and 4.
What is the length of the long side? Recall that the Pythagorean Theorem
tells us that:

$$
\triangle = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}
$$

Write a BSL expression that produces the value of this expresion for this triangle where the other two sides have lengths 3 and 4.
